#BibleBuster

##Collaborators 
Jake Tansey and Brent Pendergraft

1. Repo URL: https://github.com/penDerGraft/QAProject
2. This is a site where people can ask questions about the Bible, and get answers from other users. 
3. Known bugs: sometimes after logout the page still needs to be refreshed to reflect the change, but we couldn't
	recreate this error when we tried. 
4. We implemented the ng-really directive for prompting the user before deletion of answer
5. We pair programmed the project using Brent's computer, and spent most of our time in the lab. For part of the project not done in the lab Jake worked on the styles for the voting system, and Brent worked on the logout/edit/delete functions.
